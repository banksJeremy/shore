				<p>
					Shore is a math library being implemented in CoffeeScript. A browser interface is included.
				</p> 
				
				<p>
					The interface is being developed in Chrome, but is intended to be functional in all relatively modern browsers when it's finished.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Documentation and this page are a low priority since the basic functionality isn't finished yet. It'll be nicer later. For now more details <em>might</em> be available in the README file, which you can <a href="https://github.com/jeremybanks/shore/blob/master/README.md">view on GitHub</a>.
