				<p>
					Shore is a math library implemented in CoffeeScript. A browser interface is included, along with the compiled JavaScript, so it should be usable on its own or as library "out-of-the-box".
				</p> 
				
				<p>
					Developed with Chrome, should work the same in Safari, a bit less polished in Firefox and Opera, and remain functional in IE.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Documentation and this page are a low priority since the basic functionality isn't finished yet. It'll be nicer later.
