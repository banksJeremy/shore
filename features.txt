Every time I try to get something done I fall victim to terrible feature
creep, so I need to decide in advance what the scope of this should be.

Let's start with a relatively minimal set.
- Arithmatic, exponents, logarithms, imaginary numbers
- Differentiation, possibly trivial integration
- Margin of error
- Possibly restrictions
- Variable identifiers/names abstracted away from the math.
- No inequalities for now
