Shore Math Engine
=================

Some math implemented in CoffeeScript, with a browser interface. The 
compiled JavaScript version is included.

Developed with Chrome, should work the same in Safari, a bit less polished in 
Firefox and Opera, and remain functional in IE.

I recommend you download MathJax and put it in ./dep/MathJax/ to use the
interface but should can fall back to a plain text output without it. node.js
and Jison are required if you want to modify the parser used by the interface.

TODO
----
- Canonize sums, products
  - Commutativity! Do it!
- Unify products and exponents as originally?
- Generalize most attributes to .components, which Value can canonize for
  recursive thingies, rather than having to manually write those out.
- Error calculations
- Differentiation
- Trivial integration
- Support HTML5 offline cache
- Parse multilines to system
