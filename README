Shore Math Engine
=================

Some math implemented in CoffeeScript, with a browser interface. The 
compiled JavaScript version is included. I recommend you download MathJax and
put it in ./dep/MathJax/ to use the interface but it can fall back to plain
text without out it. node.js and jison are required if you want to modify the
parser in the interface.

Make this decent before showing off.
Every time I try to get something done I fall victim to terrible feature
creep, so I need to decide in advance what the scope of this should be.

TODO
----

Let's start with a relatively minimal set.
- Arithmatic, exponents
- Differentiation, possibly trivial integration
- Margin of error
- Equalities
