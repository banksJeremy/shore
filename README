Shore Math Engine
=================

Some math implemented in CoffeeScript, with a browser interface. The 
compiled JavaScript version is included.

Developed with Chrome, should work the same in Safari, a bit less polished in 
Firefox and Opera, and remain functional in IE.

I recommend you download MathJax and put it in ./dep/MathJax/ to use the
interface but should can fall back to a plain text output without it. node.js
and Jison are required if you want to modify the parser used by the interface.
