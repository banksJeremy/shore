About
-----

Shore is a math library implemented in CoffeeScript. A browser interface is
included, along with the compiled JavaScript, so it should be usable on its
own or as library "out-of-the-box".

Developed with Chrome, should work the same in Safari, a bit less polished in 
Firefox and Opera, and remain functional in IE.

The interface has a LaTeX-style output format that requires you download
MathJax to `dep/MathJax`. If you do not it will fall back to plain-text output,
but at least for the moment this isn't given much attention.

Using the library on its own requires only `shore.*`, but you'll
probably also want to include `shore.parser.*`.

It is intended that this will eventually be able to gracefully degrade in the
absence of JavaScript and allow the calculations to be performed server-side,
presumably using node.js. But not yet.

Modifying the parser requires node.js and Jison.

Dependencies
------------

### To Use

- Web browser
- [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) recommended (place in `dep/mathjax-1.0.1`)
  
  A plain-text fallback is available but it's not very good.

### To Build Shore (Excluding Parser)

- [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/)

### To Build Parser

- [Jison](http://zaach.github.com/jison/)
- [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)

### To Build Stylesheet

- [Sass][http://sass-lang.com/]

Documentation
-------------

There'll be some once version 1.0 is finished.

TODO
----

### `v0.1`

  - Organize canonizations better.
  - Merge `shore.Exponent` into `shore.Product`.
  - Support engineering notation in `shore.parser`.
  - All simple canonizations of `shore.Product`, `shore.Exponent`,
    `shore.Derivative`, `shore.Integral`
  - Make interface code better, so it can be dropped into something else.
    - split much of main.coffee into shore.ui.coffee

### `v0.2`

  - Complete initial version of `shore.WithMarginOfError`.
  - Pretty formatting for `shore.Number`?

### `v1.0`

  - x ~ ~ t for double integral, etc.
  - Make the code decent
  - Write at least some basic documentation
  - Documentation!

### `v1.1`

  - `shore.System`
    - Parsed from multiline input.
    - Can substitute value to solve simple systems.
    - Maybe add/remove restrictions where appropriate?

### `v1.2`

- `shore.Inequality`
  - Just â‰  for now.
- `shore.Restricted`
  - Implications of potential division by zero, and such.

### Non-concrete Future Thinkings

  - Memoization.
  - Abstract away identifier values.
  - Support HTML5 offline cache?
  - Make nice on iPod touch/iPhone.
  - Maybe allow more classical functions via subscripts:
    fib_n = fib_(n-1) + fib_(n-2); fib_0 = fib_1 = 1
